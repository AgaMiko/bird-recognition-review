# Introduction
What are challenges in bird song recognition?
Elias Sprengel, Martin Jaggi, Yannic Kilcher, and Thomas Hofmann in their paper [Audio Based Bird Species Identification using
Deep Learning Techniques](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1609/16090547.pdf) point out some very important issues:
* Background noise in the recordings - city noises, churches, cars...
* Very often multiple birds singing at the same time - multi-label classification problem
* Differences between mating calls and songs - mating calls are short, whereas songs are longer 
* Inter-species variance - same bird species singing in different countries might sound completely different
* Variable length of sound recordings
* Large number of different species

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <details><summary> Abstract </summary>
   Ecoacoustics has the potential to provide a large amount of information about the abundance of many animal species at a relatively low cost. Acoustic recording units are widely used in field data collection, but the facilities to reliably process the data recorded – recognizing calls that are relatively infrequent, and often significantly degraded by noise and distance to the microphone – are not well-developed yet.
    We propose a call detection method for continuous field recordings that can be trained quickly and easily on new species, and degrades gracefully with increased noise or distance from the microphone. The method is based on the reconstruction of the sound from a subset of the wavelet nodes (elements in the wavelet packet decomposition tree). It is intended as a preprocessing filter, therefore we aim to minimize false negatives: false positives can be removed in subsequent processing, but missed calls will not be looked at again.
    We compare our method to standard call detection methods, and also to machine learning methods (using as input features either wavelet energies or Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) on real-world noisy field recordings of six bird species. The results show that our method has higher recall (proportion detected) than the alternative methods: 87% with 85% specificity on >53 hr of test data, resulting in an 80% reduction in the amount of data that needed further verification. It detected >60% of calls that were extremely faint (far away), even with high background noise.
    This preprocessing method is available in our AviaNZ bioacoustic analysis program and enables the user to significantly reduce the amount of subsequent processing required (whether manual or automatic) to analyse continuous field recordings collected by spatially and temporally large-scale monitoring of animal species. It can be trained to recognize new species without difficulty, and if several species are sought simultaneously, filters can be run in parallel.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <details><summary> Abstract </summary>
   The avian dawn chorus presents a challenging opportunity to test autonomous recording units (ARUs) and associated recogniser software in the types of complex acoustic environments frequently encountered in the natural world. To date, extracting information from acoustic surveys using readily-available signal recognition tools (‘recognisers’) for use in biodiversity surveys has met with limited success. Combining signal detection methods used by different recognisers could improve performance, but this approach remains untested. Here, we evaluate the ability of four commonly used and commercially- or freely-available individual recognisers to detect species, focusing on five woodland birds with widely-differing song-types. We combined the likelihood scores (of a vocalisation originating from a target species) assigned to detections made by the four recognisers to devise an ensemble approach to detecting and classifying birdsong. We then assessed the relative performance of individual recognisers and that of the ensemble models. The ensemble models out-performed the individual recognisers across all five song-types, whilst also minimising false positive error rates for all species tested. Moreover, during acoustically complex dawn choruses, with many species singing in parallel, our ensemble approach resulted in detection of 74% of singing events, on average, across the five song-types, compared to 59% when averaged across the recognisers in isolation; a marked improvement. We suggest that this ensemble approach, used with suitably trained individual recognisers, has the potential to finally open up the use of ARUs as a means of automatically detecting the occurrence of target species and identifying patterns in singing activity over time in challenging acoustic environments.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <details><summary> Abstract </summary>
     Assessing the presence and abundance of birds is important for monitoring specific species as well as overall ecosystem health. Many birds are most readily detected by their sounds, and thus, passive acoustic monitoring is highly appropriate. Yet acoustic monitoring is often held back by practical limitations such as the need for manual configuration, reliance on example sound libraries, low accuracy, low robustness, and limited ability to generalise to novel acoustic conditions.
    Here, we report outcomes from a collaborative data challenge. We present new acoustic monitoring datasets, summarise the machine learning techniques proposed by challenge teams, conduct detailed performance evaluation, and discuss how such approaches to detection can be integrated into remote monitoring projects.
    Multiple methods were able to attain performance of around 88% area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), much higher performance than previous general‐purpose methods.
    With modern machine learning, including deep learning, general‐purpose acoustic bird detection can achieve very high retrieval rates in remote monitoring data, with no manual recalibration, and no pretraining of the detector for the target species or the acoustic conditions in the target environment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <details><summary> Abstract </summary>
  Accurate prediction of bird species from audio recordings
is beneficial to bird conservation. Thanks to the rapid advance in deep
learning, the accuracy of bird species identification from audio recordings
has greatly improved in recent years. This year, the BirdCLEF2019[4]
task invited participants to design a system that could recognize 659
bird species from 50,000 audio recordings. The challenges in this competition included memory management, the number of bird species for the
machine to recognize, and the mismatch in signal-to-noise ratio between
the training and the testing sets. To participate in this competition,
we adopted two recently popular convolutional neural network architectures — the ResNet[1] and the inception model[13]. The inception model
achieved 0.16 classification mean average precision (c-mAP) and ranked
the second place among five teams that successfully submitted their predictions.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <details><summary> Abstract </summary>
  The BirdCLEF challenge—as part of the 2019 LifeCLEF Lab[7]—offers a large-scale proving ground for system-oriented evaluation ofbird species identification based on audio recordings. The challenge usesdata  collected  through  Xeno-canto,  the  worldwide  community  of  birdsound recordists. This ensures that BirdCLEF is close to the conditionsof  real-world  application,  in  particular  with  regard  to  the  number  ofspecies in the training set (659). In 2019, the challenge was focused onthe difficult task of recognizing all birds vocalizing in omni-directionalsoundscape recordings. Therefore, the dataset of the previous year wasextended with more than 350 hours of manually annotated soundscapesthat were recorded using 30 field recorders in Ithaca (NY, USA). Thispaper describes the methodology of the conducted evaluation as well asthe synthesis of the main results and lessons learned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <details><summary> Abstract </summary>
  This paper addresses real-time bird song scene analysis. Observation of animal behavior such as communication of wild birds would be aided by a portable device implementing a real-time system that can localize sound sources, measure their timing, classify their sources, and visualize these factors of sources. The difficulty of such a system is an integration of these functions considering the real-time requirement. To realize such a system, we propose a cascaded approach, cascading sound source detection, localization, separation, feature extraction, classification, and visualization for bird song analysis. Our system is constructed by combining an open source software for robot audition called HARK and a deep learning library to implement a bird song classifier based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Considering portability, we implemented this system on a single-board computer, Jetson TX2, with a microphone array and developed a prototype device for bird song scene analysis. A preliminary experiment confirms a computational time for the whole system to realize a real-time system. Also, an additional experiment with a bird song dataset revealed a trade-off relationship between classification accuracy and time consuming and the effectiveness of our classifier.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <details><summary> Abstract </summary>
 onservationists are increasingly using autonomous acoustic recorders to determine the presence/absence and the abundance of bird species. Unlike humans, these recorders can be left in the field for extensive periods of time in any habitat. Although data acquisition is automated, manual processing of recordings is labour intensive, tedious, and prone to bias due to observer variations. Hence automated birdsong recognition is an efficient alternative.
However, only few ecologists and conservationists utilise the existing birdsong recognisers to process unattended field recordings because the software calibration time is exceptionally high and requires considerable knowledge in signal processing and underlying systems, making the tools less user‐friendly. Even allowing for these difficulties, getting accurate results is exceedingly hard. In this review we examine the state‐of‐the‐art, summarising and discussing the methods currently available for each of the essential parts of a birdsong recogniser, and also available software. The key reasons behind poor automated recognition are that field recordings are very noisy, calls from birds that are a long way from the recorder can be faint or corrupted, and there are overlapping calls from many different birds. In addition, there can be large numbers of different species calling in one recording, and therefore the method has to scale to large numbers of species, or at least avoid misclassifying another species as one of particular interest. We found that these areas of importance, particularly the question of noise reduction, are amongst the least researched. In cases where accurate recognition of individual species is essential, such as in conservation work, we suggest that specialised (species‐specific) methods of passive acoustic monitoring are required. We also believe that it is important that comparable measures, and datasets, are used to enable methods to be compared.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <details><summary> Abstract </summary>
 The BirdCLEF challenge offers a large-scale proving groundfor system-oriented evaluation of bird species identification based on au-dio recordings of their sounds. One of its strengths is that it uses datacollected through Xeno-canto, the worldwide community of bird soundrecordists. This ensures that BirdCLEF is close to the conditions of real-world application, in particular with regard to the number of species inthe training set (1500). Two main scenarios are evaluated: (i) the identifi-cation of a particular bird species in a recording, and (ii), the recognitionof all species vocalising in a long sequence (up to one hour) of raw sound-scapes that can contain tens of birds singing more or less simultaneously.This paper reports an overview of the systems developed by the six par-ticipating  research  groups,  the  methodology  of  the  evaluation  of  theirperformance, and an analysis and discussion of the results obtained.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <details><summary> Abstract </summary>
Non-invasive bioacoustic monitoring is becoming increasingly popular for biodiversity conservation. Two automated methods for acoustic classification of bird species currently used are frame-based methods, a model that uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and event-based methods, a model consisting of descriptive measurements or restricted to tonal or harmonic vocalizations. In this work, we propose a new method for automated field recording analysis with improved automated segmentation and robust bird species classification. We used a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based frame selection with an event-energy-based sifting procedure that selected representative acoustic events. We employed a Mel, band-pass filter bank on each event's spectrogram. The output in each subband was parameterized by an autoregressive (AR) model, which resulted in a feature consisting of all model coefficients. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used for classification. The significance of the proposed method lies in the parameterized features depicting the species-specific spectral pattern. This experiment used a control audio dataset and real-world audio dataset comprised of field recordings of eleven bird species from the Xeno-canto Archive, consisting of 2762 bird acoustic events with 339 detected “unknown” events (corresponding to noise or unknown species vocalizations). Compared with other recent approaches, our proposed method provides comparable identification performance with respect to the eleven species of interest. Meanwhile, superior robustness in real-world scenarios is achieved, which is expressed as the considerable improvement from 0.632 to 0.928 for the F-score metric regarding the “unknown” events. The advantage makes the proposed method more suitable for automated field recording analysis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <details><summary> Abstract </summary> Automated classification of organisms to species based on their vocalizations would contribute tremendously to abilities to monitor biodiversity, with a wide range of applications in the field of ecology. In particular, automated classification of migrating birds' flight calls could yield new biological insights and conservation applications for birds that vocalize during migration. In this paper we explore state-of-the-art classification techniques for large-vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls. In particular, we contrast a “shallow learning” approach based on unsupervised dictionary learning with a deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation. We show that the two models perform comparably on a dataset of 5428 flight calls spanning 43 different species, with both significantly outperforming an MFCC baseline. Finally, we show that by combining the models using a simple late-fusion approach we can further improve the results, obtaining a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 0.96.</details>

This work presents a new approach that performs simultaneous segmentation and classification of bird species using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with encoder-decoder architecture.

 We present and compare two approaches to detect the presence of bird calls in audio recordings using convolutional neural networks on mel spectrograms. In a signal processing challenge using environmental recordings from three very different sources, only two of them available for supervised training, we obtained an Area Under Curve (AUC) measure of 89% on the hidden test set, higher than any other contestant. By comparing multiple variations of our systems, we find that despite very different architectures, both approaches can be tuned to perform equally well. Further improvements will likely require a radically different approach to dealing with the discrepancy between data sources.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <details><summary> Abstract </summary> Songbirds provide neuroscience with a model system for understanding how the brain learns and produces a motor skill similar to speech.
Much like humans, songbirds learn their vocalizations from social interactions
during a critical period in development. Each bird’s song consists of repeated
elements referred to as “syllables”. To analyze song, scientists label syllables
by hand, but a bird can produce hundreds of songs a day, many more than
can be labeled. Several groups have applied machine learning algorithms to
automate labeling of syllables, but little work has been done comparing these
various algorithms. For example, there are articles that propose using support
vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and even deep learning
to automate labeling song of the Bengalese Finch (a species whose behavior
has made it the subject of an increasing number of neuroscience studies).
This paper compares algorithms for classifying Bengalese Finch syllables (building on previous work [https://youtu.be/ghgniK4X_Js]). Using a standard crossvalidation approach, classifiers were trained on syllables from a given bird,
and then classifier accuracy was measured with large hand-labeled testing
datasets for that bird. The results suggest that both k-NN and SVM with a
non-linear kernel achieve higher accuracy than a previously published linear
SVM method. Experiments also demonstrate that the accuracy of linear SVM
is impaired by "intro syllables", a low-amplitude high-noise syllable found in
all Bengalese Finch songs. Testing of machine learning algorithms was carried out using Scikit-learn and Numpy/Scipy via Anaconda. Figures from this

 In this paper we present a new audio classification methodfor bird species identification. Whereas most approaches apply nearestneighbour matching [6] or decision trees [8] using extracted templates foreach bird species, ours draws upon techniques from speech recognitionand recent advances in the domain of deep learning. With novel prepro-cessing and data augmentation methods, we train a convolutional neuralnetwork on the biggest publicly available dataset [5]. Our network archi-tecture achieves a mean average precision score of 0.686 when predictingthe main species of each sound file and scores 0.555 when backgroundspecies  are  used  as  additional  prediction  targets.  As  this  performancesurpasses current state of the art results, our approach won this yearsinternational BirdCLEF 2016 Recognition Challenge [3,4,1].

 Many biological monitoring projects rely on acoustic detection of birds.

Limited data occur because of limited recordings or the existence of rare phrases. In this paper, classification of up to 81 phrase classes of Cassin's Vireo is performed using one to five training samples per class. The algorithm involves dynamic time warping (DTW) and two passes of sparse representation (SR) classification. DTW improves the similarity between training and test phrases from the same class in the presence of individual bird differences and phrase segmentation inconsistencies. The SR classifier works by finding a sparse linear combination of training feature vectors from all classes that best approximates the test feature vector. When the class decisions from DTW and the first pass SR classification are different, SR classification is repeated using training samples from these two conflicting classes. Compared to DTW, support vector machines, and an SR classifier without DTW, the proposed classifier achieves the highest classification accuracies of 94% and 89% on manually segmented and automatically segmented phrases, respectively, from unseen Cassin's Vireo individuals, using five training samples per class.</details> 

# Competitions
![Flying bird](http://www.kuwaitbirds.org/sites/default/files/files-misc/birding-bird-shapes-1.jpg)
- [BirdCLEF 2021 - Birdcall Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdclef-2021) - identify which birds are calling in long recordings, given training data generated in meaningfully different contexts. This is the exact problem facing scientists trying to automate the remote monitoring of bird populations. This competition builds on the previous one by adding soundscapes from new locations, more bird species, richer metadata about the test set recordings, and soundscapes to the train set.
- [kaggle - Cornell Birdcall Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition/overview) - Build tools for bird population monitoring. Identify a wide variety of bird vocalizations in soundscape recordings. Due to the complexity of the recordings, they contain weak labels. There might be anthropogenic sounds (e.g., airplane overflights) or other bird and non-bird (e.g., chipmunk) calls in the background, with a particular labeled bird species in the foreground. Bring your new ideas to build effective detectors and classifiers for analyzing complex soundscape recordings!
- [LifeCLEF 2020 - BirdCLEF](https://www.imageclef.org/BirdCLEF2020) - Two scenarios will be evaluated: (i) the recognition of all specimens singing in a long sequence (up to one hour) of raw soundscapes that can contain tens of birds singing simultaneously, and (ii) chorus source separation in complex soundscapes that were recorded in stereo at very high sampling rate (250 kHz SR).
The training set used for the challenge will be a version of the 2019 training set enriched by new contributions from the Xeno-canto network and a geographic extension. It will contain approximately 80K recordings covering between 1500 and 2000 species from North, Central and South America, as well as Europe. This will be the largest bioacoustic dataset used in the literature. 
- [LifeCLEF 2019 Bird Recognition](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/lifeclef-2019-bird-recognition) - The goal of the challenge is to detect and classify all audible bird vocalizations within the provided soundscape recordings. Each soundscape is divided into segments of 5 seconds. Participants should submit a list of species associated with probability scores for each segment.
- [LifeCLEF 2018 Bird - Monophone](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/lifeclef-2018-bird-monophone) - The goal of the task is to identify the species of the most audible bird (i.e. the one that was intended to be recorded) in each of the provided test recordings. Therefore, the evaluated systems have to return a ranked list of possible species for each of the 12,347 test recordings. 
- [LifeCLEF 2018 Bird - Soundscape](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/lifeclef-2018-bird-soundscape) - The goal of the task is to localize and identify all audible birds within the provided soundscape recordings. Each soundscape is divided into segments of 5 seconds, and a list of species associated to probability scores will have to be returned for each segment. 
- [Bird audio detection DCASE2018](http://dcase.community/challenge2018/task-bird-audio-detection) - The task is to design a system that, given a short audio recording, returns a binary decision for the presence/absence of bird sound (bird sound of any kind). The output can be just "0" or "1", but we encourage weighted/probability outputs in the continuous range [0,1] for the purposes of evaluation. For the main assessment we will use the well-known "Area Under the ROC Curve" (AUC) measure of classification performance.
- [Bird Audio Detection Challenge 2016–2017](http://machine-listening.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/bird-audio-detection-challenge/) - contest organized in collaboration with the IEEE Signal Processing Society. They propose a research data challenge to create a robust and scalable bird detection algorithm. Organizers offer new datasets collected in real live bioacoustics monitoring projects, and an objective, standardised evaluation framework – and prizes for the strongest submissions. Results and summary of the best submissions can be found [here](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/events/badchallenge_results/).
